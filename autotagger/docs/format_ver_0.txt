Autotagger Transcription Format Ver. 0.0

1. A Transcription File consists of a list of Transcription Pages.
A Transcription Page necessarily starts with strings that match this regex:

/^Page\s+(\d+)/

This string must appear on its own line and match this regex exactly. 
No white space is allowed in front of the word "Page" and nothing is allowed to follow
the page number.



2. A Transcription Page consists of a "header" followed by a "body" where the header
is indicated by a string matching this regex:

/\s*Margins?:?/
	
Do not include anything else on this line. Information for the "header" will follow
in the lines below it. Also, make sure that there are no empty lines between this 
and the line with the page number.

3. The header contains two kinds of information: marginal notes and titles for 
div2s. Marginal notes are indicated with a string matching this regex:

/\s*Line\s+(\d+):?\s*(.*)$/

Once again, it is important that the strings match perfectly. A string such as
"Line 2-4" or "Line 2,3,4" will not work with the autotagger. 
div2 titles are indicated with a string matching this regex:

/\s*DivLine:?\s*(.*)$/

As before, these strings should appear on their own line. Every "Line" and 
"DivLine" must appear at the top of the page with no empty lines in between them
as well as no empty space between "Margins:" and the topmost line of header content.
No other content is allowed in the header. If a line that doesn't match any of these
keywords is found in the header, an error will be thrown.

4. The end of the header is indicated by an empty line. All content found below the
first empty line is considered content for the body.

5. Paragraphs are indicated by a string matching this regex:

/^\s+(\S+)/

Any sort of white space can be used to indicate a paragraph.

6.  div1s are indicated in the body text with two lines. The first line is a string
match this regex:

/\s*Text:?/

The second line is a string matching this regex:

/\s*Line\s+(\d+):?\s*(.*)$/

As always, the strings must match the regexes perfectly. Also, these two lines must
always be found together. If a line containing "Text:" is found without "Line" 
directly underneath it (or vice-versa), the autotagger considers that to be an error.

7. Every DivLine found in the header must have a corresponding line in the body
that matches this regex:

/^\s*\*(.*)$/

If there are too many or too few of these lines in the body, an error will be thrown.

8. Beware of unintentional double-spacing. If a file is found to contain double-spacing,
a warning will be issued although the autotagger will work normally in case it is 
intentional.
