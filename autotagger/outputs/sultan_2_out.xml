						Upon rubbing my face in the dust at the feet of your Lordship my fortune-blessed father. 

						<lb n="5"/>
						O my fortune’s blessing, in a dream your humble servant witnessed that a person was reciting
						<lb n="6"/>
						the Qur’an in a loud voice. Because of this recitation, we were so overwhelmed by ecstasy that
						<lb n="7"/>
						we nearly lost our mind. Our father and mother came and restrained us only with difficulty.
						<lb n="8"/>
						Then we also witnessed that a woman had written the image of a moon on her breast. My sultan’s will be done.

					<p>
						My fortune-blessed father, upon rubbing my face in the dust at your feet... In a dream 

						<lb n="10"/>
						one witnessed that we were reciting the Joseph Chapter (Sura Yūsuf) and interpreting it. In the part
						<lb n="11"/>
						where Joseph’s brothers came to get wheat, while they were conversing with Joseph, he said, “go
						<lb n="12"/>
						and bring my father.” And however many responses were talked about, I gave a response to each of them.
						<lb n="13"/>
						My sultan’s will be done.
