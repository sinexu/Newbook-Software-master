						O my fortune’s blessing, in a dream your humble servant witnessed that a person was reciting
						<lb n="6"/>
						the Qur’an in a loud voice. Because of this recitation, we were so overwhelmed by ecstasy
						<lb n="7"/>
						that we nearly lost our mind. Our father and mother came and restrained us only with difficulty.

						Then we also witnessed that a woman had written the image of a moon on her breast. My

						sultan’s will be done.

							My fortune-blessed father, upon rubbing my face in the dust at your feet... In a dream
						<lb n="12"/>
						one witnessed that we were reciting the Joseph Chapter (Sura Yūsuf) and interpreting it. In
						<lb n="13"/>
						the part where Joseph’s brothers came to get wheat, while they were conversing with Joseph, he said,
						<lb n="14"/>
						“go and bring my father.” And however many responses were talked about, I gave a response to
						<lb n="15"/>
						each of them. My sultan’s will be done.
