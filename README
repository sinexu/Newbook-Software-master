README for Newbook install script
=================================

run with LOCATION as a local path or a host:path or user@host:path

 # Needs rsync and permission to write to /tmp and LOCATION 

./install LOCATION

 Ideally, this  sets up to access LOCATION as a web interface for Newbook
autotagger and xslt.

potential problems:
 * permission to create LOCATION/sessions and subdirs
 * cgi permission in LOCATION
   ** this is really up to the owner of LOCATION
 * need to have rsync installed
